# Application-Programming---Assignment

# The Task
Applying what you have learned in the module, you are asked to write your own 2- dimmensional shape-based serious game to help improve awareness about keeping safe from Covid-19. This could be related to maintaining personal or food hygiene and sanitation, maintaining social distancing, properly wearing PPE, or keeping others safe. A serious game is a game where the main objective of the game is not just entertainment. Instead it is to achieve some purpose such as: increase awareness, teach a concept, or get someone to perform an activity by rewarding them for it.
